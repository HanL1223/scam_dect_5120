up call\\nby joe berardino\\n12 / 04 / 2001\\nthe wall street journal\\nal 8\\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones in particular , our role as auditors of year - end financial statements presented by management . we invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year to improve our audit capabilities , train our people and enhance quality .\\nwhen a client fails , we study what happened , from top to bottom , to learn important lessons and do better . we are doing that with enron . we are cooperating fully with investigations into enron . if we have made mistakes , we will acknowledge them . if we need to make changes , we will . we are very clear about our responsibilities . what we do is important . so is getting it right .\\nenron has admitted that it made some bad investments , was over - leveraged , and authorized dealings that undermined the confidence of investors , credit - rating agencies , and trading counter - parties . enron \\' s trading business and its revenue streams collapsed , leading to bankruptcy .\\nif lessons are to be learned from enron , a range of broader issues need to be addressed . among them :\\n- - rethinking some of our accounting standards . like the tax code , our accounting rules and literature have grown in volume and complexity as we have attempted to turn an art into a science . in the process , we have fostered a technical , legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with the form rather than the substance of what is reported .\\nenron provides a good example of how such orthodoxy can make it harder for investors to appreciate what \\' s going on in a business . like many companies today , enron used sophisticated financing vehicles known as special purpose entities ( spes ) and other off - balance - sheet structures . such vehicles permit companies , like enron , to increase leverage without having to report debt on their balance sheet . wall street has helped companies raise billions with these structured financings , which are well known to analysts and investors .\\nas the rules stand today , sponsoring companies can keep the assets and liabilities of spes off their consolidated financial statements , even though they retain a majority of the related risks and rewards . basing the accounting rules on a risk / reward concept would give investors more information about the consolidated entity \\' s financial position by having more of the assets and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet ; certainly more information than disclosure alone could ever provide . the profession has been debating how to account for spes for many years . it \\' s time to rethink the rules .\\n- - modernizing our broken financial - reporting model . enron \\' s collapse , like the dot - com meltdown , is a reminder that our financial - reporting model - - with its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings - per - share number - - is out of date and unresponsive to today \\' s new business models , complex financial structures , and associated business risks .\\nenron disclosed reams of information , including an eight - page management \\' s discussion & analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report . some analysts studied these , sold short and made profits . but other sophisticated analysts and fund managers have said that , although they were confused , they bought and lost money .\\nwe need to fix this problem . we can \\' t long maintain trust in our capital markets with a financial - reporting system that delivers volumes of complex information about what happened in the past , but leaves some investors with limited understanding of what \\' s happening at the present and what is likely to occur in the future .\\nthe current financial - reporting system was created in the 1930 s for the industrial age . that was a time when assets were tangible and investors were sophisticated and few . there were no derivatives . no structured off - balance - sheet financings . no instant stock quotes or mutual funds . no first call estimates . and no lou dobbs or cnbc .\\nwe need to move quickly but carefully to a more dynamic and richer reporting model . disclosurs needs to be continuous , not periodic , to reflect today \\' s 24 / 7 capital markets . we need to provide several streams of relevant information . we need to expand the number of key performance indicators , beyond earnings per share , to present the information investors really need to understand a company \\' s business model and its business risks , financial structure and operating performance .\\n- - reforming our patchwork regulatory environment . an alphabet soup of institutions - - from the aicpa ( american institute of certified public accountants ) to the sec and the asb ( auditing standards board ) , eitf ( emerging issues task force ) and fasb ( financial accounting standards board ) to the pob ( public oversight board ) - - all have important roles in our profession \\' s regulatory framework . they are all made up of smart , diligent , well - intentioned people . but the system is not keeping up with the issues raised by today \\' s complex financial issues . standard - setting is too slow . responsibility for administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession .\\nall of us must focus on ways to improve the system . agencies need more resources and experts . processes need to be redesigned . the accounting profession needs to acknowledge concerns about our system of discipline and peer review , and address them . some criticisms are off the mark , but some are well deserved . for our part , we intend to work constructively with the sec , congress , the accounting profession and others to make the changes needed to put these concerns to rest .\\n- - improving accountability across our capital system . unfortunately , we have witnessed much of this before . two years ago , scores of new economy companies soared to irrational values then collapsed in dust as investors came to question their business models and prospects . the dot - com bubble cost investors trillions . it \\' s time to get serious about the lessons it taught us .\\nin particular , we need to consider the responsibilities and accountability of all players in the system as we review what happened at enron and the broader issues it raises . millions of individuals now depend in large measure on the integrity and stability of our capital markets for personal wealth and security .\\nof course , investors look to management , directors and accountants . but they also count on investment bankers to structure financial deals in the best interest of the company and its shareholders . they trust analysts who recommend stocks and fund managers who buy on their behalf to do their homework - - and walk away from companies they don \\' t understand . they count on bankers and credit agencies to dig deep . for our system to work in today \\' s complex economy , these checks and balances must function properly .\\nenron reminds us that the system can and must be improved . we are prepared to do our part .\\n- -

trading operations . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , dynegy shares fell $ 3 . 18 to $ 27 . 17 each , below their 52 - week low .\\n\" there is no question that something as high - profile as this will attract senior management \\' s attention for some time , \" said robert grossman , chief credit officer with debt - rating agency fitch inc . , which has had dynegy on its credit watch since dynegy agreed to the merger . \" the very fact that the lawsuit is out there poses risk in some investors \\' minds and it could limit the upper end of the stock for awhile , \" says ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg .\\nstill , dynegy is aggressively trying to build up its energy - trading business . dynegy \\' s president and chief operating officer , steve bergstrom , who worked for enron in the early 1980 s , is considered one of the brightest lights in energy trading and dynegy has been moving to bulk up its base of pipelines , production and power - plant capacity to complement its trading operations .\\nas enron was cratering last week , dynegy swiftly moved to capitalize on enron \\' s sudden inability to provide enough credit security for natural -

balance - sheet debt totals $ 31 . 24 billion . some bankers who are involved estimate the parent company has an additional $ 27 billion in off - balance - sheet and contingent liabilities . the combined list of creditors attached to enron \\' s bankruptcy filing is 54 pages long .\\nprecisely because there are so many claims , the contesting among enron \\' s creditors is expected to be especially fierce . while bankruptcy law specifies a clear ranking of claims - - with senior secured creditors at the top of the pyramid , the mass of unsecured claims beneath them and equity holders at the bottom - - bankruptcy proceedings aren \\' t always set in stone .\\n\" chapter 11 is the only place in the legal system where you can alter the rights of one creditor against another and alter the distribution of losses , \" said stephen case , a bankruptcy lawyer with davis polk wardell in new york .\\nin coming weeks , enron will file other legal documents that will be widely scrutinized by creditors and potential vulture investors , who buy distressed debt , for information about the ultimate value of the company .\\nuntil now , many distressed - debt players have been on the sidelines , citing the impossibility of understanding enron \\' s business operations , the extent of its liabilities and the possibility that its financial records contain misstatements beyond the restatements announced last month by enron .\\n\" traditionally , immediately after a bankruptcy filing , a flurry of opportunistic investors will look at the company , \" said edward tillinghast , a bankruptcy lawyer with coudert brothers in new york . \" it is easier to analyze after bankruptcy because so much more information becomes available . \"\\n\" after a filing , the paper tends to get concentrated , \" added mr . case of davis polk . \" many institutional investors have to dump their securities because they don \\' t want to be seen in [ or aren \\' t allowed to hold ] defaulted paper . so they call the vulture funds and ask them to take it off their hands . \"\\ncomplicating the negotiations : claimants and creditors are a varied lot with diverse interests , reflecting enron \\' s combination of physical and financial assets -

debt funds , which usually acquire debt positions at discounted prices , engage in a variety of strategies . for instance , they may threaten senior classes with the specter of a long drawn - out legal battle unless concessions are made . or , because each class of creditors gets to vote on any settlement , one party may buy up others \\' claims in order to control just over a third of the debt of that class -

namers are frequent takeover targets . arco , for example , was acquired by bp plc last year . pacific telesis , parent of pacific bell , agreed to be acquired by sbc communications the day before it announced a $ 50 million naming - rights deal with the san francisco giants in 1996 . shawmut national corp . paid to put its name on a new indoor arena in boston in 1993 , but the company was acquired by fleetboston financial corp . before a single game was played . the philadelphia arena formerly known as the corestates center morphed into the first union center and will become the wachovia center as soon as next summer .\\nthe deteriorating financial health of airlines imperils naming deals at six indoor arenas . the former chief executive of ual corp . , whose united airlines unit named the arena in chicago , raised the prospect of filing for bankruptcy next year . some analysts believe the parent of america west airlines , namer of the arena in phoenix , may have to file sooner , if it doesn \\' t get requested government aid .\\nnot every naming - rights deal leads inexorably to a company \\' s demise . general motors corp . ( whose name graces the arena of hockey \\' s vancouver canucks ) and pepsico inc . ( the denver nuggets and colorado avalanche ) are in no danger of disappearing . ( of course , the same would have been said about enron a few months ago . ) those who pay the big bucks believe they are getting their money \\' s worth for stadium deals , through improved name recognition and an association with active lifestyles .\\n\" it provided a unique branding opportunity that only comes around every so often , \" says robert waldrop , senior vice president of communications at reliant resources inc . , another houston energy firm . reliant last year agreed to pay roughly $ 300 million over 32 years to put its name on a football stadium for the houston texans , who will begin play next year , and adjacent livestock show and convention center . mr . waldrop says it would be \" a real long stretch \" to associate enron \\' s woes with its stadium - naming deal .\\nconsultants say the deals are particularly useful for companies that are not household names , such as european electronics giants telefon ab l . m . ericsson and koninklijke philips electronics nv . philips uses part of the atlanta arena that it named as a showcase for its products .\\nstill , consultants say prices for stadium - naming deals are drifting lower , because of the weak economy and the disappearance of internet firms , many of which were active bidders . more than a dozen u . s . stadiums and arenas are seeking sponsors , including the superdome in new orleans , home to february \\' s super bowl , comiskey park in chicago , and the former trans world dome in st . louis . wayne huizenga , who owns the dolphins and pro player stadium , has been seeking a replacement sponsor for more than a year .\\nsome companies say they \\' ve learned to shy away . \" it \\' s very expensive , \" says kristin schroer , a spokeswoman for southwest airlines , one of the few major airlines that doesn \\' t have its name on an arena . \" we would rather be able to charge our passengers lower fares so they can afford to fly to games and still have money in their pocket to buy a foam finger or eat out . \"\\n- -

go world of commodity trading are finding their own profits and accounting practices under scrutiny as well .\\nwhat ultimately triggered the collapse of investor confidence in enron were its indecipherable disclosures for related - party transactions , compounded by its admitted financial misstatements and massive off - balance - sheet liabilities . but many critics say disclosure issues of a different sort dog the financial statements of most companies that trade electricity , natural gas and the like - - with the approval of the nation \\' s accounting - rule makers .\\nat issue is a technique called \" mark to market \" accounting , under which the financial accounting standards board has given energy traders wide discretion to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize in future periods from energy - related contracts and other derivative instruments .\\nfor many energy - trading companies , significant chunks of earnings in recent years have come from recording unrealized , noncash gains through such accounting entries . often , these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors , details of which the companies don \\' t provide . and because of the minimal disclosure standards , it is difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive , or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions - - and force earnings revisions .\\n\" whenever there \\' s a considerable amount of discretion that companies have in reporting their earnings , one gets concerned that some companies may overstate those earnings in certain situations where they feel pressure to make earnings goals , \" says abn amro analyst paul patterson , who follows energy - trading firms .\\nmark - to - market accounting is required whenever companies have outstanding energy - related contracts on their balance sheets , either as assets or liabilities , at the end of a quarter . for example , these could be agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over time at certain prices . under the rules , companies estimate the fair values of the contracts . quarterly changes in value - - representing unrealized , noncash gains and losses - - then are run through the companies \\' income statements .\\none way to gauge the size of some companies \\' past unrealized gains is to dig through their cash - flow statements , which sometimes specify the noncash portion of trading gains . at enron , unrealized trading gains accounted for slightly more than half of the company \\' s $ 1 . 41 billion of originally reported pretax profit in 2000 and about a third of its originally reported pretax profit of $ 1 . 13 billion in 1999 .\\nat dynegy , unrealized gains accounted for nearly half its $ 762 million in 2000 pretax profit and about half its $ 227 million in 1999 pretax profit . dynegy executives say there isn \\' t anything wrong with the quality of their company \\' s earnings . and they point to financial reports for the first nine months of 2001 showing that none of the company \\' s reported earnings for this year came from unrealized gains .\\nother energy traders whose earnings have been boosted in recent years by mark - to - market gains include american electric power , duke energy , el paso , entergy , mirant , pinnacle west capital and williams cos .\\nhow much discretion do energy traders have in valuing their contracts ? the rule , pretty much , is that there aren \\' t many rules .\\nfor instance , during a conference last week sponsored by the fasb and the american accounting association , attendees were shown a hypothetical example under which the fair value of a power contract could range from $ 40 million to $ 153 million , depending on which assumptions of future trends were used .\\nand the mark - to - market rules that do exist for energy contracts were crafted in large part on approaches that enron and other traders lobbied for . \" we developed those rules , \" enron \\' s chief accounting officer , richard causey , said in an august interview .\\nover the past three years , members of the fasb \\' s emerging issues task force have extensively debated the subject of how to value energy - related contracts . what they have decided is that companies should be left to their own discretion , though the task force recognizes that could create problems . in a june 2000 report , for instance , the group noted that two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energy contracts , resulting in widely different valuations . \" those differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value , \" the report said .\\nthe task force \\' s chairman , tim lucas , says it simply is too difficult to draft a one - size - fits - all solution : \" there \\' s no one way to do it . there are various models , and we think it requires professional judgment to assess . \" further , he says , requiring companies to disclose all the estimates underlying their earnings would produce disclosures so voluminous that they would be of little value .\\nthat is in line with the industry \\' s longtime position . in a june 2000 letter to mr . lucas , for instance , mr . causey said \" the valuation process should be determined by individual companies , \" and the task force \" should not address the valuation methodology for energy or energy related contracts . \"\\nin its financial filings , dynegy explains that when market - price quotes aren \\' t available for certain long - term contracts , \" the lack of long - term pricing liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments . \" as a result , actual cash returns may \" vary , either positively or negatively , from the results estimated . \"\\nquoted market prices offering independent guidance on many short - term energy contracts have become more readily available in recent years . even then , there aren \\' t rules specifying which market quotes companies must use . for instance , should companies mark their contracts based on the \" bid \" price , which is the price a market maker would offer to pay for a given contract ? or should they use the \" ask \" price , which is the price at which a trader is willing to sell ? or somewhere in between ? currently , individual companies decide for themselves .\\non most contracts for short - term deliveries of natural gas , bid - ask spreads are fairly small , about 1 % or so . but even for some short - term electricity contract prices quoted on enron \\' s now - shuttered online trading portal , spreads of 20 % were common . on contracts for short -

- the bankruptcy of enron has washington debating the way it oversees the $ 200 billion power industry . but there is no consensus on erasing the legacy of deregulation that the company \\' s political largess helped forge .\\ncongressional leaders and top regulators are moving forward on what had been enron \\' s no . 1 objective : a push to reduce local control of electricity transmission lines so that energy merchants like the enron corporation can use them to transport and sell power .\\nbut the politics of power are shifting , and some of enron \\' s longstanding opponents - - chief among them the southern company of atlanta , which owns many local power monopolies - - see a fresh chance to slow deregulation , or even roll it back .\\namong those who have called for inquiries into enron \\' s collapse are representative billy tauzin , a prominent republican from louisiana who is chairman of the house energy and commerce committee ; the senate majority leader , tom daschle , and senator jeff bingaman , a democrat of new mexico who is chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee .\\nall are vowing to get to the bottom of one of the most precipitous business reversals in history . and some members of congress say enron \\' s downfall , on the heels of california \\' s energy meltdown early this year , proves that washington must demand more disclosure from energy traders , holding them at least to the standards of wall street firms .\\n\\' \\' enron is the sequela to california , it \\' s all part of the one - year story line , \\' \\' said representative edward j . markey , democrat of massachusetts , who focuses on energy regulatory issues in the house . \\' \\' we can \\' t leave energy products in the regulatory shadows . it hurts both investors and consumers . \\' \\'\\nother influential officials are in no rush to turn back the clock on deregulation .\\n\\' \\' we have had a number of false starts , and it would be crazy not to take a look at the lessons we can learn , \\' \\' said nora brownell , one of president bush \\' s appointees this year to the federal energy regulatory commission . \\' \\' but we should not leap to the conclusion that competitive markets do not work . \\' \\'\\nthe bush administration , along with some democrats - - including mr . bingaman and william massey , a democrat on the energy commission - - continue to favor plans advanced by enron that would pry open regional electricity markets .\\n\\' \\' we have to look carefully at the causes of consequences of enron \\' s collapse , \\' \\' mr . bingaman said . \\' \\' but i don \\' t see anything in this that would keep us from moving ahead with open transmission access and these types of things . \\' \\'\\nthe durability of such views is a sign of how effective enron was during the last decade in keeping washington at bay as the company pushed to restructure the electricity industry and limit government oversight of new energy markets .\\nenron and its employees were the largest contributors to president bush \\' s campaigns over the years , and enron gave more money to politicians in the last election cycle than did any other energy company . since 1993 , its employees and its chairman , kenneth l . lay , have donated nearly $ 2 million to mr . bush . in the 2000 election cycle , more than $ 1 million was donated to federal political campaigns , most of it to republicans .\\nmr . lay also had powerful friends . he recruited wendy l . gramm , the top commodities regulator in the administration of president bush \\' s father and the wife of senator phil gramm , republican of texas , to serve on enron \\' s board in 1993 . the appointment came just five weeks after ms . gramm helped push through a ruling at the commodity futures trading commission that exempted many energy contracts from regulation .\\nlast year , as congress and the clinton administration debated whether to exercise more oversight of the financial instruments used by enron and other companies to trade energy contracts , mr . lay courted linda robertson , a senior treasury official who was the department \\' s liaison with congress .\\nms . robertson twice accepted paid trips to talk with company executives while she was still employed at the treasury , her financial disclosure shows . the measure that became law , the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 , specifically exempted energy trading from the regulatory scrutiny applied to brokers of money , securities and commodities .\\nms . robertson , who became the head of enron \\' s washington office , did not return a phone call seeking comment .\\nlast spring , when the bush administration drafted a new national energy policy , mr . lay had a 30 - minute meeting with vice president dick cheney to discuss the report . the policy blueprint endorsed breaking up monopoly control of electricity transmission networks , an enron goal that was spelled out in a memorandum mr . lay discussed during his meeting with mr . cheney .\\nenron also had an unusual opportunity to influence mr . bush \\' s choices for the federal energy regulatory commission , which oversees the markets in which enron operates . mr . lay met mr . bush \\' s personnel adviser , clay johnson , to discuss nominees . when mr . bush picked people to fill two vacant republican slots on the five - member commission , both had the backing of enron as well as other companies .\\nenron did not always get its way in washington . it failed to win regulatory exemptions for some futures products it wanted to trade , for example . and with enron now discredited , its longtime nemeses like the southern company hope to turn the regulatory agenda in a direction that favors their interests .\\nthe southern company has long been enron \\' s main challenger for influence in washington . the company has nurtured a loose coalition of southeast lawmakers - - the senate minority leader , trent lott of mississippi , most prominent among them - - in support of its view that the states should retain leeway in deciding the pace and scope of energy deregulation .\\nso far this year , its political action committees have outspent all other energy companies , including enron and big oil companies like exxon mobil , in supporting members of congress , according to the u . s . public interest research group . southern strongly opposes efforts to diminish the power of local regulators to supervise electricity pricing , production and transmission .\\n\\' \\' we have long felt that enron \\' s vision of open markets does not work with electricity , \\' \\' said dwight evans , executive vice president of the southern company . \\' \\' i think our credibility has been enhanced by recent events . \\' \\'\\nmr . evans said that the federal energy regulatory commission under mr . bush had tried to \\' \\' design systems that meet what enron needs . \\' \\' congress should slow the commission , mr . evans argued , or risk a fresh bout of instability and volatile prices .\\nsome states have halted the introduction of open markets for electricity . nevada , oklahoma and new mexico are among those that have put off deregulation , while california and a few other states that once promoted unfettered competition are debating ways to reimpose regulatory control .\\nenron \\' s assiduous efforts to keep its energy trading free of government interference could be another casualty of its collapse .\\nas the value of energy contracts soared into the hundreds of billions of dollars -

term capital management . long - term capital was the hedge fund based in greenwich , conn . , that operated without direct federal oversight and , by some accounts , threatened world markets when its elaborate portfolio of derivatives crumbled in late 1998 .\\nwith its exemption from scrutiny in hand , enron revealed relatively little about its trading portfolio , leaving analysts guessing how it had made its profits . enron \\' s secrecy was one factor that caused investor confidence to plummet in recent weeks , after the company revealed some unorthodox financial arrangements that benefited top executives .\\n\\' \\' enron was getting very heavily into derivatives , and along with wall street banks , they went to bat to keep us away , \\' \\' said michael greenberger , who was director of trading and markets at the commodities futures trading commission until early this year . \\' \\' this should be as scary for regulators and congress as long -

- - the combination of big losses and white house ties would have long since produced cries for a special prosecutor to see what ( if anything ) enron \\' s buddies have done on behalf of the company . the upcoming hearings in the republican - controlled house should be fascinating , and there will doubtless be more hearings in the democratic - controlled senate .\\n\" we \\' ve had no contact with the white house \" since enron \\' s meltdown started , says company spokesman mark palmer .\\n\" i \\' m not aware that there have been any requests [ from enron ] for anything , \" a white house spokesman says .\\neven though enron shareholders have been essentially wiped out , lay isn \\' t going to the poorhouse . unlike enron employees whose retirement accounts have been vaporized because they consisted largely of enron stock the company wouldn \\' t let them sell , lay has plenty of wealth left . last year alone , he made $ 123 million of profit on stock options , according to enron filings . this year he has made an additional $ 25 million or so . note : on friday , with its stock at around 30 cents , enron changed its policy and allowed employees to sell it .\\nironically , what brought down enron from its lofty perch on the fortune 500 list ( no . 7 ) is that the markets , whose virtue it preached , lost faith in it after it disclosed funny dealings with a partnership run by its chief financial officer .\\nand now , let \\' s proceed to the syllabus of enron 101 :\\n1 . bubbles didn \\' t end\\nwhen dot - coms bombed\\nenron , a major trader of electricity and natural gas , grossed $ 200 billion a year and had $ 60 billion of assets , but it turned out to be a bubble . its business depended on borrowing lots of money . people lined up to lend as long as enron seemed healthy . when suspicions arose six weeks ago after the company revealed its partnership problems , money trickled away . then it started leaving in a flood . as enron tottered , it lost trading business . its remaining customers began to gouge it - - that \\' s how trading works in the real world . don \\' t blame the usual suspects : stock analysts . rather , blame arthur andersen , enron \\' s outside auditor , which didn \\' t blow the whistle until it was too late . ( andersen says it \\' s far too early for me to be drawing conclusions . )\\n2 . deregulation can be dangerous\\nit \\' s clear that the cozy world of utility monopolies needed to be shaken up , given huge losses on nuclear plants and other problems . besides , breakthroughs in turbine technology made it feasible for big users such as manufacturing plants to set up their own generators and drop off the electric grid . letting them go would have raised prices for everyone else . but dereg has caused lots of problems . in 1998 , the midwest had huge spikes in the price of electricity and rolling blackouts : some utilities had sold power outside their service areas , and the traders they were relying on to replace that power didn \\' t deliver . upstarts have dropped in and out of retail markets in several states , sticking established players with big costs . and , of course , there \\' s california , which got caught with too little energy in the spring ( helping enron and others make big profits ) and now is stuck with too much expensive energy . this has crippled the state \\' s finances , driven its biggest utility into bankruptcy and clobbered customers . leaving vital necessities such as electricity and natural gas to the tender mercies of the market is risky . especially when a big player such as enron can vanish overnight .\\n3 . beware your own hype\\nenron pioneered trading in electricity and natural gas , and it was the primo player in that field . but it came to believe that it was good at everything . it wasn \\' t . some of the debacles : losses of $ 2 billion each in the water and telecommunications businesses , and another $ 2 billion lost in a brazilian utility investment . it blew an additional $ 1 billion on an electricity - generating plant in india . hence , i think , the need to obscure rising debt levels and less - than - stellar results by dealing with so - called off - balance - sheet partnerships with \" star wars \" names such as jedi ( for joint energy development investments ) and chewco ( as in chewbacca , the wookiee ) . the fact that enron executives were involved in these partnerships and made money while the company got clocked didn \\' t help .\\nthe summary\\nthe enron affair reinforces two of the oldest lessons there are . to wit : when someone tells you he \\' s changing the world for the better and getting rich at the same time , hold onto your wallet . and when something sounds too good to be true , it probably isn \\' t true .\\nmichael isikoff contributed to this column .\\nsloan is newsweek \\' s wall street editor . his e -

- a takeover that fell through partly as a result of falls in enron \\' s stock price .\\na similar conflict of interest plagues audit firms . auditors are supposed to serve investors by certifying the accuracy of companies \\' financial statements . but auditors also earn consulting fees when they advise companies on information technology and other management issues . the desire to win consulting contracts may reduce auditors \\' appetite for dust - ups with companies whose accounts seem suspicious . enron \\' s auditor , arthur andersen , earned $ 27 million in consulting fees from the company last year - - slightly more than the $ 25 million it got paid to audit enron \\' s books . at the same time it failed to challenge enron \\' s habit of hiding some of its dicier business in partnerships that went unreported on the balance sheet .\\nthe conflicts of interest at stockbrokers and auditors , while similar , demand different remedies . investors themselves are in a position to correct some of the stockbroker problem : they can ignore advice from analysts at the integrated investment banks , and route their business through smaller independent stockbrokers . but the auditor conflicts need to be fixed by regulators at the securities and exchange commission . the commission \\' s last chairman , arthur levitt , took a tough line with the auditors ; his successor , harvey pitt , has struck a softer tone . with luck , mr . pitt will now adopt more of his predecessor \\' s outlook . without objective auditing , there will be more and more enrons -

rights deals , the heaviest buyers have been high - tech outfits and airlines . both of those industries are in the tank , and it seems unlikely we \\' ll see any big deals coming from those quarters anytime soon .\\n\" it is a period of uncertainty , \" said todd gruen , managing editor of a publication called naming rights deals . \" once we get a handle on where the economy is going , the naming rights industry can find its place as well . \"\\njust how difficult finding a sponsor can be during this recession is underscored by the experience of the texas rangers .\\nthe team \\' s multimillionaire owner , tom hicks , is hunting for a sponsor to buy the naming rights to what is now called the ballpark at arlington . so far , hicks and the rangers have struck out looking .\\n\" in our weakened economy , everything is kind of on hold , \" rangers president jim lites told the fort worth star - telegram recently .\\nso if enron backs away from the stadium that was to bear its name for the next 28 years , the astros will be hard pressed to quickly find a new corporate partner to fill the void .\\n\" i am guessing it will stay enron field for a while , \" gruen said .\\nin addition to the weak economy and the glut of stadiums chasing after deep - pocketed sponsors , the economics of baseball may be a spooky proposition for companies looking to use the national pastime to buy some goodwill .\\nwith no labor contract in place between the owners and the players , the specter of another work stoppage looms over the game . if that weren \\' t bad enough , baseball \\' s own commissioner says the game is bleeding $ 500 million a year , and he is seeking to shut down two franchises before the season starts this spring .\\n\" this uncertainty doesn \\' t come at a good time for the astros , \" said dean bonham , chairman of the sports marketing concern called the bonham group . \" major league baseball is on the precipice of a disaster . it is almost assured there will be a work stoppage in the next two seasons . i would categorize the impact of a work stoppage as catastrophic . . . . baseball is in serious turmoil . \"\\ngruen takes a less alarmist view of baseball \\' s future but agrees that prospective sponsors \" will probably want to wait until this labor situation is resolved . \"\\nwhich is not all bad . gruen thinks the very worst thing the astros could do is jump into a deal with another company that faces an uncertain future .\\n\" enron field is relatively new . it has only had one name , and that will keep the value higher , \" he said . \" the last thing they want to do is get involved with an unstable partner and go through this again in three or four years . that would really damage the stadium rights . \"\\ndec . 4 , 2001 , 5 : 45 pm\\nhouston chronicle\\nenron employees : tell us your stories\\ncopyright 2001 houston chronicle\\nif you are -

- enron corp . took steps monday to ensure funding for its day - to - day operations , but the company faces a difficult struggle in the months ahead as it tries rebuild itself .\\nin new york monday , u . s . bankruptcy court judge arthur gonzalez approved a plan for a group of lenders led by j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup to lend enron $ 250 million now , another $ 250 million by jan . 7 and , if all goes well , another $ 1 billion after that .\\nthe goal is to ensure that enron \\' s core energy trading business survives as a viable entity , by giving other companies confidence they can still do business with enron and expect to be paid .\\nenron officials estimate its trading business alone is worth $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion , said martin bienenstock , an attorney with weil , gotshal & manges , representing enron in the bankruptcy case .\\nenron currently has about $ 500 million in cash on hand , down from about $ 2 . 5 billion it typically had on hand before its crisis began , bienenstock said .\\nenron may never need to dip into that extra $ 1 . 5 billion in cash , bienenstock said . but just having the funds available eases its financial stress .\\n\" if we don \\' t get this credit , we may need it tomorrow , \" bienenstock told the court monday . \" if we do get it , we may never need it . \"\\nlenders who make such financing in a bankruptcy proceeding typically get high priority for repayment and their loans come with high interest rates and high underwriting fees .\\nenron chief executive officer ken lay , who didn \\' t attend monday \\' s hearing , said in a statement the $ 250 million will be used to help enron fulfill obligations needed to run its business , such as employee payroll and vendor payments for goods and services provided on or after sunday \\' s bankruptcy filing .\\nenron also is negotiating with three financial institutions in the hopes of revitalizing its wholesale trading business under a new ownership structure . bienenstock expects those talks to be completed within weeks .\\ngonzalez also signed off on a provision to let enron pay up to $ 4 , 500 in severance pay to workers being laid off . workers could get additional severance payments later as the bankruptcy progresses .\\na small number of employees may be eligible for up to $ 15 , 000 to cover travel and other expenses incurred but not reimbursed before enron sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code .\\nenron also will be allowed to keep making payments on its $ 219 million office tower that \\' s still under construction in downtown houston . enron has already paid $ 180 million toward the construction costs and any buyer of the property would need to complete the work to realize any value from the project .\\njeff mcmahon , enron \\' s chief financial officer , was the company \\' s top executive at the hearing . \" i \\' m extremely disappointed to have to be here at all , \" he said during a break in the session .\\nas the bankruptcy progresses , enron and its creditors will examine the various parts of the company and decide whether they would be more valuable being sold off or kept as ongoing operations .\\nenron \\' s major creditors will meet on dec . 12 to form a creditors committee , which will negotiate with the company on behalf of those still owed money . enron officials will be back in bankruptcy court for another hearing on dec . 14 .\\nenron \\' s chapter 11 filing is the largest bankruptcy case in u . s . corporate history . not surprisingly , gonzalez \\' s courtroom was packed monday with more than 125 attorneys and reporters .\\nenron and 13 of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors after a planned merger with dynegy fell apart and cuts in enron \\' s credit rating triggered serious problems for the company .\\nenron listed assets of $ 49 . 8 billion and liabilities of $ 31 . 2 billion , though it has other debt obligations not listed on the filings .\\nas enron decided where to file , it probably considered that houston and new york have among the nation \\' s most sophisticated bankruptcy judges and lawyers in the country , said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center and a bankruptcy specialist .\\nchoosing new york , she said , let enron avoid local issues hovering around the courthouse . and that includes current or laid - off enron workers .\\nmonday \\' s hearing was just the first step in a process that could take a year or more . despite enron \\' s statements that it plans to emerge from bankruptcy protection with a rebuilt business of some type , the odds do not favor it .\\n\" it \\' s challenging , but not impossible , \" said rapoport . \" a lot has to go right . \"\\neighty percent to 90 percent of companies will fail in their chapter 11 efforts , said jack williams , a law professor at the georgia state university college of law and scholar - in - residence at the american bankruptcy institute , a nonprofit think tank .\\nthose that fail - - even those that go in intending to reorganize - - typically end up liquidating all their assets either in the chapter 11 proceeding or converting to a chapter 7 liquidation case , he said .\\nthe biggest potential obstacles to success : a too - small asset base , not enough cash and a poor business plan , he said .\\nas a case unfolds , it \\' s not uncommon for the true value of a company \\' s assets to turn out below the company \\' s numbers , williams said .\\nsome companies actually file for chapter 11 , even though they intend to liquidate assets , experts said , as doing so gives them more control over a selloff . under a chapter 7 filing , a court - appointed trustee handles the liquidation .\\nbefore it filed , enron had put much of its portfolio of international assets up for sale . any deals now need approval from the court , with proceeds going to creditors .\\nthe creditors committee has a voice in virtually everything that is considered by the judge , said joel kay , an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy cases at hughes , watters & askanase l . l . p . in houston .\\nthat includes an opinion on whatever reorganization plan enron files with the court .\\nonce a bankruptcy petition is made , the company cannot pay any debts incurred before the filing without permission from the judge , kay said .\\nenron is expected to immediately start sorting through its leases and contracts , deciding what it needs to run the business and what is not needed .\\nfor those the judge agrees to let enron keep , it will be allowed to make payments for future goods and services . companies with contracts enron is allowed to reject will be considered creditors .\\nenron does not need court approval to spend money on what is considered the normal course of business . but if it wants to sell assets , borrow money or do something out of the ordinary , it must ask .\\nfor example , if enron reaches a plan to revamp its trading operation , the court will need to approve .\\nseveral stock analysts expressed doubt that enron will come out of chapter 11 or be able to make its trading operation work again , even if a new trading joint venture is created .\\nandre meade of commerzbank securities in new york said buyers and sellers of energy \" are not going to come back to this new entity in droves . \"\\n\" i \\' m having a hard time thinking of a scenario where you can actually get a workable entity out of this chapter 11 , \" he said . \" it \\' s going to be hard for them to reorganize around anything . they may not emerge from chapter 11 . \"\\nhe expects shareholders - - generally at the bottom of the creditor pool in a bankruptcy filing - - will most likely get nothing out of the bankruptcy filing .\\nthe efforts of shareholders and employees who sued enron will be delayed or halted .\\nsuch lawsuits are stayed and attorneys will have to seek permission of the bankruptcy court to move ahead .\\ndec . 4 , 2001\\nhouston chronicle\\nq & a on the enron bankruptcy\\nwhy did enron file for bankruptcy ?\\nenron \\' s increasing problems - - particularly the reduction in its bond rating to junk bond status - - triggered billions in claims that it could not afford to pay . filing for bankruptcy protection allows it to avoid paying creditors while it works out a plan to reorganize the company .\\nhow will the company fund its day - to - day business going forward ?\\nthe two top priorities now are finding a source of financing for its day - to - day operations and getting permission from the bankruptcy court to pay essential expenses - - such as their payroll and the cost of benefits like health insurance .\\nat this point why would anyone lend them another penny ?\\nafter filing for bankruptcy companies normally seek what is known as debtor - in - possession financing . lenders that provide such financing go to the front of the line when it comes time to get paid back . this agreement , which normally pays a top interest rate , has to be approved by other creditors . the creditors normally go along because continued operations will mean a bigger payout than a complete liquidation .\\nwho will get paid back ?\\nbankruptcy law sets the priorities in a bankruptcy . first in line are those with debts secured by the company \\' s property . at the bottom are common shareholders . in the middle are unsecured creditors . however , this is all subject to negotiation by the committees representing the parties in the suit .\\nif common shareholders are the last to get paid , why did the stock rise ?\\nthere \\' s no good explanation . sometimes at the start of a big case , certain parties will buy shares to win a place on the committee representing shareholders . other buyers are traders who see a short -
